# Game data (milestone Y4)

Verified facts about where the game keeps its data. Extractors live in `tools/`, their output in `private/extracted/`.

## Card names (found by Claude, 2026-10-12)
- **Pointer table**: 900 little-endian words at `0x08D310E4`..`0x08D31EF4`. Entry k → card number k+1
  (1 = Blue-Eyes White Dragon, 2 = Mystical Elf, 3 = Hitotsu-Me Giant, 900 = "7 Completed").
- **Record**: `$0<English>$1<French>$2<German>$3<Italian>$4<Spanish>$5<Japanese>` then `00`.
  Japanese is Shift-JIS. In the European names an accented letter is `0x87` + a letter
  (seen: `87 61` = é in "Géant"/"terminées", `87 5F` = ä in "Blauäugiger", `87 65` = í in "místico").
  Unverified: the full `0x87` table.
- Cards 584–587 ("Spirit Message I/N/A/L") use Shift-JIS `81 68` (”) as quote marks inside the English name.
- The word just before the table (`0x080A6838`) points to a Shift-JIS string, not a `$0` record: not part of it.
- Extractor: `tools/extract_card_names.py` (job J0004) → `private/extracted/card_names.tsv`;
  check `tools/test_card_names.py`.
